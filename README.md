# WatPi 
### Say wat?

## Project Overview
This little robot called **WatPi** is assembled using a Raspberry Pi 3, a PiCamera, a DC motor HAT, a chassis kit, and a pair of googly eyes.
WatPi is controlled using a web app powered by Django. On the "dashboard" page of the web app, the user can drive the WatPi using a virtual game control panel. The user can also take pictures and see what WatPi sees when it's roaming around in the world. WatPi can also tell what's in the picture, and complement on the scenes it sees. It might say, for instance, "hey, nice ceiling!", or "hey, nice robot!".
WatPi doesn't like to be controlled by multiple people all at once, but audience can still participate by visiting the "gallery" page. When WatPi takes a picture, and the user who controls it decides to share, the audience can see the picture on the gallery page.

## List of Materials
- A Raspberry Pi, RPi (we used Raspberry Pi 3). Get it at [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055).
- A SD card. (You will need a SD card to install the OS on the Pi).
- A DC Stepper Motor HAT for the Pi (we used AdaFruit's Stepper Motor HAT). Get it at [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348).
- A PiCamera. Get it at [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3099).
- A mini robot rover (we used AdaFruit's Mini Robot Rover Chassis Kit - 2WD with DC Motors). Get it at [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2939).
- Power for the Pi. (we used a mobile phone power bank to set WatPi free). 
- Power for the motor HAT. (we used a battery case that carries 4 AA batteries). Get it at [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/830).
- Some breadboarding wire for connection between the Pi and HAT.
- Electrical tapes.
- Googly eyes. Get it from the internet.

## Assembly and Installation Guides
We have much help from AdaFruit's learning guide. We'd like to share our resource here. You can also see collection of resources on our [GitHub Wiki Page](https://github.com/WatPi/WatPi/wiki).
